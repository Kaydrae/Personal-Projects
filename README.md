This includes all the source code and pictures for the projects that i've been working on in my extra time

#Emergency Compliment (Android)
I was actully watching a video on a youtube channel called vsause when he started naming websites and Emergency Compliment came up in his discussion. After Checking it out I thought "What if this was mobile?" Then poof! This app was born. Now I did not create emergency compliment, or own the rights to it. I just created a the app for the mobile apps community can use and feel better about themselves.

#Hello World (java FX)
I started playing with java fx and scene builder. I started with using eclipse, I added the plugin and downloaded scene builder. Did have a "Access denied" problem but fixed it easily by moving the secene builder location. After making a hello wolrd project, I found it kind of complex. I also created a java fx project on netbeans and seen it was more straightforward. So in eclipse I made a hello world program similar to the one netbeans did. In the Future I will make a template out of this "Hello World" project and maybe even make a plugin containing this. I find this way a better way to start building a java fx program. 

#Array(java)
Just a program that is playing with arrays. Enjoy :)
