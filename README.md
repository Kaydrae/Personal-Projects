#Emergency Compliment
I was actully watching a video on a youtube channel called vsause when he started naming websites and Emergency Compliment came up in his discussion. After Checking it out I thought "What if this was mobile?" Then poof! This app was born. Now I did not create emergency compliment, or own the rights to it. I just created a the app for the mobile apps community can use and feel better about themselves.
